# RockPaperScissors

## Instructions:
1. Open the [Weather App](https://weather-app-by-eleni.netlify.app/)
2. Enter the name of the location you wish to search in the search box
3. Click Submit


### What I have used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- API


### What I have learned:
- Using Asynchronous functions - async and await
- Fetching data using APIs
- Using JSON
- Inserting and editing SVGs based on the outcome of the user's input
- Replacing the result if the user searches for more than one location
- Using custom downloadable fonts
- Using event listeners
   


### Improvements to be made:
- Applying different styles/sizes for different device sizes using @media
- Adding more icons for different weather results e.g. clear
- Including a drop down list for the user to select a location from when user types something in the search box
